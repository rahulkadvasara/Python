# You are given an integer array nums. In one operation, you can add or subtract 1 from any element of nums.

# Return the minimum number of operations to make all elements of nums divisible by 3.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]

# Output: 3

# Explanation:

# All array elements can be made divisible by 3 using 3 operations:

# Subtract 1 from 1.
# Add 1 to 2.
# Subtract 1 from 4.
# Example 2:

# Input: nums = [3,6,9]

# Output: 0

 

# Constraints:

# 1 <= nums.length <= 50
# 1 <= nums[i] <= 50
